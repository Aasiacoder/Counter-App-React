Counter App with Hide/Show Feature
This is a simple Counter Application built using React, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The app allows users to manually increment the counter value and provides a hide/show feature to display or hide the counter value using buttons.

Features
Manual Increment: Users can increase the counter value by clicking a button.
Hide/Show Counter: A button is provided to hide or show the current counter value.
React State Management: The app uses React's useState hook to manage the counter state and visibility.
Dynamic UI Updates: The counter value and its visibility update dynamically based on user interaction.
